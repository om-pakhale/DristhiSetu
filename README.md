## 📌 Overview

**DrishtiSetu AI** is an edge-native, offline-tolerant retinal diagnostic screening copilot designed for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) triage in resource-limited rural Primary Health Centres (PHCs).

Unlike academic "black-box" models that rely on high-bandwidth cloud APIs and high-end GPUs, DrishtiSetu couples a deep learning classifier with **deterministic clinical safety rules**, **Res-UNet biomarker segmentation**, and an **offline store-and-forward telemedicine cache**. The system runs on standard non-GPU laptops in under 30 seconds per scan.

## 🚀 Key Features & Pipeline Architecture

The platform operates across five modular pipelines:

* **1. Deterministic Image Quality Assessment (IQA):** Evaluates focus sharpness (Laplacian variance >= 22.0) and RMS contrast (>= 0.35) on-device. High-quality images pass untouched, borderline scans receive green-channel CLAHE, and poor exposures trigger immediate retake alerts to eliminate patient recall delays.
* **2. Res-UNet Biomarker Segmentation:** A 4-level encoder-decoder network (~7.8M parameters) trained on benchmark datasets (IDRiD, DDR, Messidor-2). It segments 6 retinal structures: optic disc, fovea, blood vessels, microaneurysms, hard exudates, and hemorrhages.
* **3. Severity Staging & Hybrid Safety Interlock:** Predicts ICDR Levels 0–4 via fine-tuned ResNet-18. Hard-coded clinical rules override the neural network to force urgent or emergency specialist referrals whenever foveal threats (<= 500 um) or multi-quadrant hemorrhages are detected, guaranteeing >= 90% sensitivity and >= 85% specificity for referable DR (Level >= 2).
* **4. Dual Explainability & Automated PDF Reporting:** Combines Layer-4 Grad-CAM saliency heatmaps with 4-color lesion segmentation masks and exports an audit-ready single-page A4 clinical diagnostic report (PDF) for rapid physician sign-off.
* **5. Simulink Store-and-Forward Telemedicine:** A discrete-event network queue with a 256 MB local flash buffer guaranteeing zero data loss during rural WAN drops (10–1000 kbps), allowing 1 district specialist to oversee up to 150,000 annual screenings.

* Deep Learning Toolbox
* Image Processing Toolbox
* Computer Vision Toolbox
* Simulink



### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/om-pakhale/DristhiSetu.git](https://github.com/om-pakhale/DristhiSetu.git)
cd DristhiSetu

```

### Launch the Application

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
2. In the MATLAB Command Window, run:

```matlab

## 📊 Clinical ICDR Staging Reference

| Level | Severity Stage | Clinical Biomarkers Identified | Referral Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Level 0** | Normal | Uniform background, zero high-frequency lesions | Routine Annual Screening |
| **Level 1** | Mild NPDR | Isolated microaneurysms only | 12-Month Monitoring |
| **Level 2** | Moderate NPDR | Multiple microaneurysms, hard exudates, minor hemorrhages | Referable DR (Specialist Review) |
| **Level 3** | Severe NPDR | Blot hemorrhages in all 4 quadrants, significant exudate rings | Urgent Referral (Within 1 Week) |
| **Level 4** | Proliferative DR | Neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, foveal encroachment (<= 500 um) | Emergency Referral (Immediate) |
